## Median Rest API

This is backend REST API for a blog application called "Median" (a simple Medium clone). You will get started by creating a new NestJS project. Then you will start your own PostgreSQL server and connect to it using Prisma. Finally, you will build the REST API and document it with Swagger.

### Tools
- NestJS as the backend framework
- Prisma as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Swagger as the API documentation tool
- TypeScript as the programming language
